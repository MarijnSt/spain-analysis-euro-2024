# Spain Analysis Euro 2024

This project is part of a job interview. The goal of this analysis is to create graphics that will be used in a short presentation of three slides on the **attacking style of Spain**.

As it's a pretty short presentation I decided to focus on three things:
* How does Spain build up from the goalkeeper?
* How does Spain create danger?
* What is Spain's attacking style?

## Slide 1: How does Spain build up from the goalkeeper?

Based on the answers I find when going through the data, I would like to conclude how Spain builds up from the goalkeeper and more importantly indicate where their strengths and weaknesses are.

## Slide 2: How does Spain create danger?

I want to see whether Spain is most dangerous from set pieces or open play. Depending on what I find, I'll dig deeper and see how they use set pieces or where their chances are coming from in open play.

## Slide 3: What is Spain's attacking style?

In the final part I'll look at how Spain compares to other teams in the tournament in a couple of metrics that could identify their attacking style. For example:
* Passing: short passing v direct passing
* Progression: progressive passing v progressive carries
* Channels: wing play v central play
* Danger source: Set piece xG v open play xG (from slide 2)
* Build up: short v direct (from slide 1)
* Chance creation: volume v shot quality
* Speed: patient v fast
* Press resistance: quick release v patient possession
* Attacking transition: keep possession v quick counter attack
